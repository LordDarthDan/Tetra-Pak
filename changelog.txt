Version 0.1
    First release!
    Adds support for Create's materials:
        Andesite Alloy - Between iron and andesite in effectiveness. Also quite workable.
        Brass - A slight upgrade to iron. Very workable.
        Refined Radiance - Chops down trees in a single chop when made into an axe or adze. Otherwise, decent high-tier material.
        Rose Quartz - Usable as a socketed gem to increase reach distance by two blocks.
        Shadow Steel - Highly effective and multiplies experience at the cost of nullifying drops.
    Known issues: Deforesting and Voiding don't quite work correctly together. Will be fixed soon, but for now enjoy fast deforesters!
