Version 0.1.1
    Changes in this version:
        Refined Radiance tools now have the 'Radiant' trait, which does different things depending on the tool. As of now, only Deforesting is implemented.
        Added a new secret module, the Nullifier! Try seeing what you can do with a belt while holding Create materials.
        Added stat bars for Deforesting, Voiding, and Nullifying!
    Known issues: Deforesting and Voiding synergy is still broken. Nullifiers also behave strangely with things that modify fall speed.

Version 0.1
    First release!
    Adds support for Create's materials:
        Andesite Alloy - Between iron and andesite in effectiveness. Also quite workable.
        Brass - A slight upgrade to iron. Very workable.
        Refined Radiance - Chops down trees in a single chop when made into an axe or adze. Otherwise, decent high-tier material.
        Rose Quartz - Usable as a socketed gem to increase reach distance by two blocks.
        Shadow Steel - Highly effective and multiplies experience at the cost of nullifying drops.
    Known issues: Deforesting and Voiding don't quite work correctly together. Will be fixed soon, but for now enjoy fast deforesters!
