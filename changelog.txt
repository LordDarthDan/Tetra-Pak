Version 0.2.1
    Improvements and fixes:
        Refined Radiance modules will now receive their proper effects when crafted.

Version 0.2
    New content in this version:
        Druidcraft support has been added! Moonstone is now usable as a tool material and several other gems from the mod can be socketed for neat effects.
        Another new secret belt module has been added! This module channels the power of the moon to allow you to see better under the moonlight.
    Improvements and fixes:
        Brass has been re-adjusted to a sensible level. Goodbye absurd bows :(
        Create support has been expanded! Now, Refined Radiance does something different for each of the 'main' tools, i.e. shovel, axe, and pickaxe.
        New tooltips have been added for several of the effects added by the mod to clarify how they work.
        You can now make a Shadow Steel hammer to get rid of forges you aren't particularly fond of.
        It is now possible to use Tetra-Pak and Tetranomicon together! This requires a datapack linked on this mod's CurseForge page.
        Deforesting and other Radiant effects now work correctly with Voiding and other loot modifiers.
        The Nullifier + Slow Fall strangeness has been fixed. Now, having both will combine the effects reasonably - unfortunately including the shorter jump of Slow Falling.

Version 0.1.1
    Changes in this version:
        Refined Radiance tools now have the 'Radiant' trait, which does different things depending on the tool. As of now, only Deforesting is implemented.
        Added a new secret module, the Nullifier! Try seeing what you can do with a belt while holding Create materials.
        Added stat bars for Deforesting, Voiding, and Nullifying!
    Known issues: Deforesting and Voiding synergy is still broken. Nullifiers also behave strangely with things that modify fall speed.

Version 0.1
    First release!
    Adds support for Create's materials:
        Andesite Alloy - Between iron and andesite in effectiveness. Also quite workable.
        Brass - A slight upgrade to iron. Very workable.
        Refined Radiance - Chops down trees in a single chop when made into an axe or adze. Otherwise, decent high-tier material.
        Rose Quartz - Usable as a socketed gem to increase reach distance by two blocks.
        Shadow Steel - Highly effective and multiplies experience at the cost of nullifying drops.
    Known issues: Deforesting and Voiding don't quite work correctly together. Will be fixed soon, but for now enjoy fast deforesters!
